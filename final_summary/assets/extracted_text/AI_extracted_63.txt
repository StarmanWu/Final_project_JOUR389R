EIU student government swears in new senator
Jason Coulombe, Student Government Reporter
Â·
October 10, 2024
Jason Coulombe Student senator Megan Fox was appointed to parliamentarian at the student senate meeting on Wednesday in the Tuscola-Arcola Room.
The student senate's meeting saw the appointment of several senators to varies positions and the appointment of a new student senator.
Unofficial special election votes indicate that senator Megan Fox won the special election for elected senator. Fox received 156 votes in favor and 19 against, giving her an 89% simple majority. 
Fox will take the oath of office at the next student senate meeting on Oct. 16 at 7 p.m. Fox was also appointed as senate parliamentarian. 
The parliamentarian meets with the speaker of the senate, serves as the acting secretary should they not be present and will keep order of all senate business, according to Speaker of the Senate Madison Veatch.
Fox was appointed with a vote of 11 in favor with none opposed and with Fox abstaining. 
Senator Preston Siewert and Vice President of Student Affairs Mason Tegeler were appointed to the student action team. 
Student action team is an organization that works for EIU students by representing EIU's student government at the state and local level. 
"The purpose of the EIU student action team is to represent the interests of EIU students and to present those interests. SAT strives to work closely with state and local lawmakers in Illinois to improve the quality of education and financial support for EIU students," according to its about section on EIU's website.
Freshman criminal justice major Clint Chamley was appointed to the student senate.
Director of student life Ceci Brinker gave her report to the senate.
"Homecoming week was a great week of actives and events" Brinker said. "There will be a survey going out next week to faculty, staff, and student we want your input on how we can improve to make homecoming a success."
Homecoming committee is looking for students for next year.
"Later this semester or early spring semester, applications will be going out for any students looking to be a part of the planning committee," Brinker said.
Events that were discussed included times for senate-on-the-go.
Senate-on-the-go are student senate meetings that take place outside of the regular meeting room of the Tuscola-Arcola room in the Martin Luther King Jr. University Union.
The next meeting will be on Oct. 30 in the Witters Conference Room, on the fourth floor of Booth Library.
The meeting is meant to also celebrate Halloween according to Veatch.
"We will hold a costume contest for us as well as students who come" Veatch said, "We are also going to do goodie bags for the senate and people in the audience."
Another senate-on-the-go meeting is planned for Nov. 6 in the South Quad Commons also at 7 p.m., though it is still to be determined. 
Take Back the Night is an event that is happening on Oct. 21 at 7 p.m.
TBTN is a walking event to raise awareness for domestic abuse and violence as well as sexual violence.
The event will be occurring around the Panther Trail, starting in the EIU Campus Pond Pavilion registration is from 6:30 to 7 p.m. The event is $10 for students and $20 for non-students, with the money going to Prevail Illinois, an organization that fights against sexual abuse and violence.
A candlelight vigil will happen after the walk from 8 to 8:30 p.m.
