Government Technology Data Reporter Nikki Davidson tasked Google's AI tool Gemini (formerly Bard) to explore AI's perspective on government technology use. Davidson's innovative approach involved treating AI as a collaborative partner to generate insights on AI's potential applications in government. Despite Gemini's occasional inaccuracies and deviations from instructions, Davidson's project yielded diverse and unexpected use cases across different areas, such as mental health, opioid use and climate change.
Gemini's recommendations extended to climate challenges and infrastructure needs, reflecting a surprisingly deep understanding of regional concerns. Gemini itself suggested it would be five to 10 years before AI is fully integrated in government operations, emphasizing that it is inevitable for government.
Believing turnabout is fair play, Davidson asked Gemini for feedback on her work. It gave the article a strong numerical grade on a scale of 1 to 10 but did have suggestions on how to make it better. Human reviewers, including Benjamin Palacio, a senior IT analyst with Placer County, Calif., highlighted both the promise and challenges of AI applications, particularly in sensitive areas like mental health support. Davidson views AI as a valuable tool but underscores the necessity of human oversight and awareness of its limitations.
