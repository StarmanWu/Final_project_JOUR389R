Aug. 7â€”Telehealth Week @ TTUHSC, a conference about digital innovation, will offer an immersive experience in
digital health using technology for access to care. The free conference, which takes place Sept. 19-21 at the
TTUHSC Academic Event Center located at 3601 Fourth St., is open to all clinicians, administrators, health care
providers and stakeholders.

The conference aims to demonstrate how digital health enhances access to care and solves rural health
disparities. Three goals of the conference include:

>> Exposing stakeholders to the broader goals of digital health at TTUHSC

>> Motivating stakeholders to go beyond telehealth and embrace the fullness of digital health

>> Celebrating and launching the Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation

"Health care in this region is a collaboration of many stakeholders," TTUHSC President Lori Rice-Spearman said in
a news release. "We're proud to be among those preparing the providers and delivering excellent research-backed
care, but we also want to identify and implement innovative initiatives that truly transform health care."

TTUHSC Executive Director for the Institute of Telehealth and Digital Innovation John Gachago said digital health
is all-encompassing and includes a variety of current and emerging digital tools to improve health care delivery.

"When we look at digital health, it includes all tools to leverage technology not only to improve access, but also to
improve health care as a whole," Gachago said in the release. "Some of these technologies are current while
others are emerging, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things and blockchain technology. If
leveraged strategically, these technologies have the capacity to enhance health care outcomes and lower the cost
of care."

TTUHSC's telehealth programs continue to bridge the barriers in the 108-county service area of West Texas
through new projects and innovations to expand telemedicine into most rural areas.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 2

Telehealth Week @ TTUHSC will focus on three tracks that include: an introduction to telehealth; rural health care;

Organ Delivery Drone Project; and a TTUHSC Telehealth Poster Showcase.
